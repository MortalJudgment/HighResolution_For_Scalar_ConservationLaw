## Introduction

Welcome to the High-Resolution Methods for Scalar Conservation Law graduate thesis project! This README provides an overview of the project, details about the folder structure, prerequisites, installation instructions, usage guidelines, features, how to contribute, licensing, and contact information.

## Project Overview

This graduate thesis project focuses on the development and analysis of high-resolution numerical methods for solving scalar conservation laws. The project utilizes MATLAB for implementing and testing these methods.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

1. **Burger1DEquation**: This folder contains MATLAB scripts and code related to the 1D Burger's equation, including high-resolution methods for solving it.

2. **LinearWave**: This folder contains MATLAB scripts and code related to solving the linear wave equation using high-resolution methods.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **MATLAB**: You should have MATLAB installed on your computer.
